One of the cityâ€™s largest historic districts, the Upper East Side was built in three phases. From the 1860s to 1880, Italianate and Greek Revival brownstones, still found on side streets, were constructed. Luxurious Beaux-Arts and French Renaissance mansions were built for the wealthiest of New York City families between 1880 and 1910. Luxury apartment buildings began to grow in the early teens.
